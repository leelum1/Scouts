              <h1 class="display-4 my-3">The Patrol Method</h1>
              <p>The Patrol Method is how scout troops are organized throughout the
                world. Baden-Powell recognized that boys naturally form themselves
                in to cliques or groups in any environment and wanted to use this
                behavior to promote a sense of responsibility and brotherhood.</p>

              <p>Each scout troop is lead by the Scout Leader, who appoints a Troop
                Leader and Assistant Troop Leaders from among the more experienced
                scouts to assist with the management of the troop. The scout troop
                is divided into patrols, which are each led by a Patrol and Assistant
                Patrol Leader.</p>

              </div>

              <p>In patrols, scouts rely on each other to carry out tasks. Patrols
                are required to work as a team at scouting events. For example, at
                camp, scouts of the same patrol will share a tent, prepare food and
                eat together, and go to activities as a patrol. A sense
                of camaraderie is built up, especially when competeing against other
                patrols in races or regattas. In addition, patrol leaders and assistant
                patrol leaders gain valuable leadership experience.</p>

              <p>Patrols are encouraged to problem solve on their own. If a scout
                has a problem regarding a particular situation or another scout, it
                should be brought to the attention of the Patrol Leader and Assistant
                Patrol Leader. The Patrol Leader may decide to bring the problem
                to the Troop Leader depending on the severity of the problem, who
                may then get the Scout Leader and other adult Leaders involved.</p>

              <h2>1st Trinidad Sea Scouts Patrols</h2>
              <p>There are four patrols in our troop. They are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Seagull Tadpoles</li>
                <li>Otter Shrimps</li>
                <li>Curlew Dophins</li>
                <li>Beaver Seals</li>
              </ul>

              <p>The first word in the patrol name refers to the senior scouts in
                the patrol, while the second word refers to the juniors. For example,
                in the Seagulls Tadpoles patrol, the senior scouts would be referred
                to as Seagulls and the juniors would be referred to as Tadpoles. There
                is also sometimes a Junior Patrol Leader, and Assistant Junior Patrol
                Leader depending on the size of the Patrol.</p>

              <p>For national of international events, scouts may be reassigned to
                new patrols to account for scouts who are unable to attend or merging with other troops.
                There is also a temporary troop called Squids, where new Recruits
                are placed before they are assigned to a Patrol. Patrols members can be viewed
                <a href="http://1tss.org/patrols.html">on the Patrols page here</a>.
