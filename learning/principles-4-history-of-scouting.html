              <p>Lieutenant General Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell is known
                as the Founder of Scouting. Born in 1857 in London, England, Baden-Powell
                served as a Lieutenant in the British Army and was stationed mainly
                in Africa and Asia. While in Africa, Baden-Powell began to formulate
                his idea of scouting based on his military experience.</p>

              <p>After his military service, Baden-Powell dedicated the rest of his
                life to Scouting, growing and spreading the movement across the world.
                Baden-Powell died in 1941 and his grave is in St Peter's Cemetery
                in Nyeri, Kenya. At the time of his death, there were over 3 million
                scouts throughout the world.</p>

              <p>Fun Fact: Baden-Powell's car (a 20-horsepower Rolls-Royce) was nicknamed 'Jam Roll'.</p>

              <h2>Origin of Scouting</h2>
              <p>On his return to England, Baden-Powell wanted to test out his ideas
                for Scouting. In August 1907, he held an experimental camp at Brownsea
                Island in Dorset, England with 20 boys where he tested The Patrol
                Method, and taught them Scouting skills. The camp was a great success,
                and Baden-Powell published his ideas in a book titled 'Scouting for
                Boys'. The book became very popular, and soon scout troops began
                to form throughout the country.</p>

              <p>Scouting for Boys was translated in other languages and soon Scouting
                became a worldwide movement. Scouting was introduced in Trinidad and
                Tobago in 1912. Girl Guides was also born of this movement,
                as well as other variations of Scouting such as Air Scouts, Sea Scouts,
                Cub Scouts, and Rover Scouts. Currently, there are over 50 million
                registered Scouts throughout the world. </p>
