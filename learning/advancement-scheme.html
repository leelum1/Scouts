              <p>The Scout Advancement Scheme provides a syllabus for scouts to
                follow to learn the Scouting skills. It is developed and managed
                by the Scout Association of Trinidad and Tobago. There are five
                levels of advancement:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Membership</li>
                <li>Scout Standard</li>
                <li>Advanced Scout Standard</li>
                <li>Chief Scout Award</li>
