              <p>One of the most frequent asked by foreigners is what type of government we have.
                Trinidad and Tobago has a
                <strong>parliamentary democracy, </strong>
                which was inherited from Britain after gaining independence on August 31st, 1962.
                Trinidad and Tobago became a Republic state in 1976, which means that
                the country is "owned" by all citizens (as compared to a monarchy),
                and is governed by representatives elected by the public.</p>

              <p>The <strong>President </strong>is the Head of State and is the
                nominal source of executive power, meaning that they do not have
                an active role in parliament but must still assent to all bills passed
                in both Houses of Parliament before they become law. The president
                is elected by all members of the Senate and the House of Representatives,
                and serves a five year term.</p>

              <p>There are three branches of government:
                <ul>
                  <li><a href="#executive">Executive</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#legislative">Legislative</a></li>
                  <li><a href="#judicial">Judicial</a></li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sub-topic" id="executive">
              <h2>Executive Branch</h2>
              <div class="my-3" style="text-align:center;">
                <img src="images/whitehall.jpg" width="500" alt="">
                <p class="caption">Whitehall is the official office of the Prime Minister</p>
              </div>
              <p>The Executive Branch is comprised of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.
                The Cabinet refers to the Ministers for each government
                Ministry (Ministry of Finance, National Security, Housing and Urban
                Development, Public Utilities, Education, etc.), which is led by the Prime Minister.
                The <strong>Prime Minister</strong> is appointed by the President
                as the person with the most support from the House of Reprsentatives,
                which is usually the leader of the poiltical party that won the election.
                The Cabinet effectively has control of the nation's affairs through
                the different Ministries.</p>

              <p>The Legislative branch of government, more commonly referred to as <strong>Parliament</strong>
                is responsible for debating and passing  laws for the peace, order
                and good governance of Trinidad and Tobago. It is comprised of the <strong>Senate</strong>
                and the <strong>House of Representatives</strong>.</p>

              <p>The Senate has
              31 members appointed by the President based on the advice of the
              Prime Minister, the leader of the Opposition, and to represent the
              sectors of civil society. The House of Representatives has 41 members,
              who are elected by the public in the general elections to represent their constituencies.

              <p>Tobago has its own elected House of Assembly responsible for the
                administration of the island, and for the implementation of policies
                that are referred by Parliament.</p>

            <div class="sub-topic" id="judicial">
              <h2>Judicial Branch</h2>
              <p>The third branch of government is the <strong>Judiciary</strong>,
                which is responsible for administering justice. The Court of Appeal
                is the country's highest court, and is headed by the <strong>Chief Justice</strong>
                The Chief Justice is appointed by the President on advice of the
                Prime Minister and the leader of the Opposition.
