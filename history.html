          <p>St. Mary's College was famous for its rowing teams, in the early 1920's.
            Two past pupils, John and James Sneddon were the expert and dedicated
            coaches. Seeing the success of the team over the years, there were many
            proposals and discussions about the possible formation of a Boating Club
            and as to its form and working. A number of St. Mary's boys were members
            of the 9th Port of Spain Troop (attached to St. Patrick's parish) and Fr.
            English, a priest at the College, who had contact with this group realised
            the possibilities waiting to be tapped at the College. With his strong
            encouragement, it was finally decided that the new College Club would
            follow the rules and regulations of a Sea Scout Troop. At its beginning the Scoutmaster was Mr. John Sneddon. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="year-div">
          <h2 class="year-heading">1920's</h2>
          <p>The Troop planned to take its place quietly in the Port of Spain local
            Association, as the First Port of Spain Sea Scouts, but were obliged by
            the Scout Authorities to register under the more challenging title of
            First Trinidad Sea Scouts. In January 1923, the scout uniforms, which had
            been ordered from Scout Headquarters, cream woolen jerseys and navy blue
            trousers, and the flat sea-scout hats, arrived from England making an
            investiture possible. This solemn taking of the Scout Promise took place
            on the 25th February at the College.</p>
        </div>
        <p>In later years the
          burden and the privilege of running the scouts fell on Father Tom Kennedy
          from 1931- 1972. </p>
        <p>The First Camp was held at Kronstadt in 1922. In 1923 the Troop camped
          at Clarke's Bay in Gasparee. Nelson Island, one of the Five Islands, was
          the site of the camp for 1925. A four-day Patrol Leaders' camp was held
          at Blue Basin during the Easter Holidays in 1926. Camps were held regularly
          once a year, up to the departure of Father Buyse as Chaplain; in 1927 at
          Staubles Bay, 1928 was devoted to fixing up the new Club Room, 1929 at
          Palourde, 1930 there was no camp, 1931 six days at Paxvale, the Trinidad
          Scouts' organisation, new camping ground at Santa Cruz. In 1932 the Annual
          camp was replaced by an eight-day cruise on the auxiliary yacht "Psyche".
          The general camp for the Troop was held at Palourde Bay Monos. With the
          advent of Fr Kennedy a new era of overseas camping began. Camps were held
          in Barbados, Tobago, St. Lucia, Grenada, St. Vincent and Venezuela.</p>
        <div class="year-div">
          <h2 class="year-heading">1940's</h2>
        </div>
        <p>In 1944 a lease was obtained of a small piece of land on the sea front
          at Mucurapo. Immediately fund raising was started so that a "Club House"
          could be put up. Soon Father Kennedy's attention shifted from the building
          to the reclamation of the frontage as the sea continued to silt up in front
          of the slipway. This land reclamation was a Herculean task continued over
          many, many years. It could be discouraging work as the sea continually
          washed away the fill, but nevertheless the land crept ever further seaward.
          When Father Murray took over the Troop, officially in 1973, he was faced
          with a deteriorating building and also undertook the task of extending
          further seaward and consolidating the gains already made.</p>
        <p>Escondida Cove is a small very sheltered bay on the western side of Point
          Gourde. On the hill overlooking the bay was an old wooden holiday house
          which was abandoned when the Americans acquired their 99 years lease on
          Chaguaramas in 1943. Access from the mainland is had through the property
          of the Alcan Bauxite Transshipment station. In 1947, Father Kennedy
          acquired unofficially caretaker's rights to the house. The first major
          camp was held there in 1947. Eventually the building had crumbled away
          completely and in the early 1960's it was abandoned. The scouts then used
          the level area at the foot of the hill as a campsite. Escondida holds many
          precious memories for the past scouts - "of fellows drinking stop rot for
          coffee and eating hard backs for raisins in the bakes; lingering memories
          of Joey's bakes, John Martinez' entree and Hugh Spicer's commentaries on
          food properties in general'". When Fr Murray became Scout Master in the
          early 1970's great changes were wrought on the camp site making it
          eventually one of the finest camping sites in the West Indies. The amount
          of hard work put into this patch of land is unbelievable, especially when
          it is realised that it was basically the work of schoolboys. In 1979 a new
          jetty was built, involving some blasting. In 1980 the campsite was covered
          with thirty feet of waste bauxite in order to prevent the growth of
          'pricker bush'. This was successful. Then 57 loads of topsoil gave a smooth
          surface that was planted with Bermuda grass. In 1981 the acquisition of a
          minibus for the Troop allowed the transporting of more scouts to work. The
          following year the floor of the tents was raised up with soil from the hill
          and shrubs and trees planted (which had to be watered for the first three
          dry seasons if they were to survive). By 1984 an eight-foot high wall of
          solid stone was built over campsite bay and the campsite was further graded
          with 40 loads of soil and a boundary fence planted. The following years,
          changing rooms were built and roofed and proper toilets constructed with
          water tanks to feed them. With the campsite now properly prepared it was
          fully utilised. The boats rowed down and tents and food could be brought
          in by the mini-bus through the Alcan area.</p>

          <p>First Trinidad Sea Scouts celebrates 100 years!</p>
        </div>
        <p>For very many years the First Trinidad Sea Scouts featured a drum and
          bugle band which played on many important occasions in the College. For
          the past 20 years Life Saving has been the Hall Mark of the First Trinidad
          Sea Scouts. The Troop continues regularly to assist the orphanages on their
          beach outings by providing Lifeguard services for the children.</p>
        <p>To run a scout troop successfully and to have a club House and boats kept
          in good order is a very expensive undertaking. The scouts themselves who
          in addition to their scouting activities have to keep an eye on their
          studies are manifestly unable to handle fund raising on their own. For
          the whole of the 75 years of the Troop's existence there has existed a
          committee which has generously and unselfishly looked after the raising
          of funds. The two mainstays for regular funding became Bingo and later
          Barbecue.</p>
        <p>A number of prominent citizens are past members of the Troop including
          former President Ellis Clarke, former Chief Justice Michael De La Bastide,
          former Commander of the Coast Guard Jack Williams along with a number of
          others. The Troop continues the tradition up to this day and there are many
          past and present members of the Troop whose academic achievements and
          scouting skills rank among the best.</p>
